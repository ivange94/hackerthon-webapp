# Hackerthon Webapp

Front end for the hackerthon app

## Setup

### Fork repo

### Clone your fork

  `git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubId/hackerthon-webapp.git`
  
Add a remote repository pointing to the original repo

   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ivange94/hackerthon-webapp.git`
    
### Sync your repo

   `git pull --rebase upstream master`
   
### Install dependencies

  `cd hackethon-webapp`

  `npm install`

### Launch dev server

   `ng serve`
   
Your application will be running on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and has live reload set up automatically. So every change you make to the UI will be automatically reloaded.

## Make changes

Create an issue here [issues](https://github.com/ivange94/hackerthon-webapp/issues)

And submit a pull request.

Before making a pull requesting make sure your repo is up to date with upstream by running `git pull --rebase upstream master`. The `--rebase` makes sure your commits will always be on top when you creating your pull request.

Thanks.
